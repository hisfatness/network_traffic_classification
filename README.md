# Deep Learning Models for Network Traffic Classification

## Introduction
In this project, we explore various deep learning models for classifying network traffic. Our goal is to accurately identify different types of network packets based on their characteristics. We'll cover the following topics:

1. **Dataset**: Description of the dataset used for training and evaluation.
2. **Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps, including feature extraction and normalization.
3. **Model Architectures**: Overview of the deep learning architectures we'll experiment with.
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the models, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating their performance.
5. **Results and Discussion**: Analyzing the results and discussing insights.

## Dataset
We'll use a publicly available network traffic dataset containing packet-level information. The dataset includes features such as packet size, protocol type, source/destination IP addresses, and more.

## Preprocessing
Before feeding the data to our models, we'll perform the following preprocessing steps:
- Feature extraction: Extract relevant features from raw packet data.
- Normalization: Scale features to a common range (e.g., [0, 1]).

## Model Architectures
We'll experiment with the following deep learning architectures:
1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Suitable for capturing spatial patterns in packet data.
2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Useful for sequences of packets (e.g., time-series data).
3. **Hybrid Models**: Combining CNNs and RNNs for improved performance.

## Training and Evaluation
1. **Data Split**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Model Training**: Train each architecture using appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results and Discussion
We'll compare the performance of different models and discuss their strengths and limitations. Additionally, we'll explore misclassified samples to identify areas for improvement.
